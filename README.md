# Credit Card User Clustering

## Abstract
This study focuses on clustering credit card users to understand spending and behavior patterns for targeted marketing strategies. Various clustering models were analyzed to identify distinct consumer segments based on credit card usage. Key findings include different preferences like cash-in-advance, installment purchases, and full repayment behaviors, effectively segmented using advanced clustering algorithms (Mainly using Model-Based Clustering). The practical application of this research allows credit card companies to tailor offers to meet specific consumer needs, potentially increasing profitability. Future work might include integrating real-time data to refine these clustering techniques and exploring the impact of economic changes on consumer behavior. This research enhances understanding of consumer financial behavior in a detailed and actionable manner, providing significant value to marketers in the highly competitive credit card industry.

## Introduction
### Background of Study with Research Objective
Consumer spending is a key factor in business decision-making. Credit card usage has increased in recent years, making it crucial for companies to understand consumer behavior to tailor their offerings and remain competitive.

## Literature Review
### Cash-in-Advance Preference
### Installment Purchases Preference
### Revolvers with Expensive Purchases
### Full Repayment Preference
### Active Users with High Spending and Repayment

## Research Gap
Despite extensive research, significant gaps remain in understanding how specific behavioral patterns influence future consumer actions, especially in a volatile economic environment.

## Methodology
### Data Cleaning and Manipulation
### Feature Understanding with EDA, and Selection and Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
### Cluster Tendency Assessment
### Clustering Models
- CLARA Clustering Algorithm Model
- Hierarchical K-Means Clustering Algorithm Model
- Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm Model
- Model-Based Clustering with EM Algorithm Model
- Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) Algorithm Model

## Data
A detailed Kaggle dataset of 9000 active credit card holders with 18 behavioral variables was used.

## Results
### Hypothesis Testing Results

## Discussion
### Analysis
### Model Effectiveness
### Challenges and Limitations
### Theoretical Implications
### Practical Applications

## Future Work and Improvements
Future research could expand by integrating real-time data analysis to adapt clustering models dynamically, enhancing predictive accuracy and relevance. This approach could also explore the impact of economic shifts on consumer behavior, ensuring models remain robust over time.
